# To-Do App

This To-Do App is a simple web application built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and React. It allows users to create and manage their to-do lists in a convenient and organized manner.

## Basic Features

The To-Do App includes the following basic features:

. Node.js/Express Server: The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust and efficient server environment.

. PostgreSQL Database: The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store and manage the to-do tasks and user data securely.

. React for Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a dynamic and interactive user experience.

. Command to Start Client and Server on Windows: The project generator (https://github.com/brunovmc/project_generator) assists in setting up the client and server components easily. It provides a command to start both the client and server, allowing for quick and seamless development.

## How Was It Built?

The To-Do App was built within a timeframe of 8 hours with the assistance of the project generator mentioned above. The project generator automates the initial setup and configuration, making it faster to bootstrap a new project. The combination of the project generator and the ChatGPT model (such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5) enables developers to expedite their development process and generate high-quality code and documentation.

Feel free to explore the To-Do App and customize it to fit your specific requirements. Happy task managing!
